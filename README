up.finalrewind.org is a simple web upload service.  This is early-development
software, everything (including the project name) may change any time.

# Deployment

Minimum working example:

* `git clone https://github.com/derf/up.finalrewind.org.git`
* `cd up.finalrewind.org`
* `mkdir cache`
* `LISTEN=http://127.0.0.1:port hypnotoad index.pl`

In general: Clone the repo and run `hypnotoad index.pl` somewhere, and make
sure that the `cache` directory is writable by the hypnotoad user. To run
the service under systemd, see the service file provided in the example
directory.

Then configure your web server as a reverse proxy for the specified port with
HTTP Basic Auth on the /add and /list URLs and to set the remote user in the
X-Remote-User header (e.g. `proxy_set_header X-Remote-User $remote_user;` for
nginx).
